#  Roshambo Assignment

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this assignment is to practice different methods of performing a segue. Three methods are used in this assignment:
1. Storyboard segue
2. Using `present()`
3. Using `performSegue()`

The assignment also allowed us to practice with the `switch` statement.

## How to play

This game plays like a standard Rock - Paper - Scissors game. Click on the image corresponding to the move you would like to make. The app generates a random move for the opponent. A new screen will be displayed modally to indicate whether you won, lost, or tied.
